# Hypothesis-Testing

Activity 1 :
Download data for last 1 year for the S&P500 and any 10 of its component stocks. Download data from an
appropriate financial website such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Quandl, CityFALCON, or another
similar source.

ACTIVITY 2 :
Calculate daily returns of the S&P500 index and the downloaded stocks over the period under study.

ACTIVITY 3 :
For each of the selected stocks and the index perform a Studentâ€™s T test, calculate the p-value and t-value
and test the Null Hypothesis that the mean daily stock return is zero.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
Based on the results of your findings, complete the following analysis:
1. For how many stocks was the null hypothesis accepted.

If we look into values of these T Tests, t values are very higher (more than 5%), hence large t-score
tells us that there is high probability to have mean daily return equal to zero. Also, lower P values
indicates that there are some remarkable change in mean daily return but very little. Hence, though Null
hypothesis was rejected by computer program, there is very higher probability that these stocks and
Index will have their mean daily return very close to zero.

2. Given that you drew the stocks randomly from the index constituents, is it possible to
extrapolate the behavior of the index (in terms of the null hypothesis) from the average results
obtained from analyzing the stocks?

S&P500 Index consists of 500 different stocks components, from different clusters of industries. Hence,
if we pick any 10 stocks at random from them, it will be difficult to extrapolate the behaviour of the Index.
Meanwhile, if we increase sample size, i.e. if number of stock components taken >30, it will give us
normal probability distribution, hence we will be in position to extrapolate the behavior of the index
by the average behaviour of these 30 or more stocks components.
